The challenges here are fairly limited! For this challenge, you should
add a challenge file to the <a href="https://github.com/sourcecred/playground/blob/master/_challenges">challenges</a> folder. You can be as creative as you like! For example:

<br>

 - You might ask the challenge requester to create a specific kind of post or gallery contribution
 - You might create a challenge linked with a specific issue
 - You might add some integration that warrants further interaction.
