Once, there was a little scripty

Who fell in love with a 3D nifti

His demeanor, discreet

He processed him with FEAT

and showcased the output with glee

Alas, there was no carpe diem

All was revealed through SPM

His beloved was paired with a .hdr

who, by default, fit him much better

and scripty’s shell was ripped open

Bashful and broken is he

No longer to run on the queue,

A lonely, outdated piece of code

he remains uncompiled on the head node

infinitely echoing “poor little old me!”

After months of cold shoulders

A python script entered his folder

All was clear with a submit

the two would make quite a fit!

to process significant BOLD

This concludes our tale

Of the little scripty who did prevail

The two found love and behold!

They made many iterations on the head node
